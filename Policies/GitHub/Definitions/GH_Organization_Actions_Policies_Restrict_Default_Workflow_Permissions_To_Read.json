  "description": "As a good security practice, you should grant the GITHUB_TOKEN the least required access. Read should be the default permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN when running workflows in your organization. You can specify more granular permissions in the workflow using YAML. Workflows have read permissions in the repository for the contents and packages scopes only.
