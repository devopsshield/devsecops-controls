  "description": "Ensure there are no Dependabot alerts for your repository with a dependency affected by a security vulnerability. Dependabot alerts tell you when your code depends on a package that is insecure. You should upgrade to a secure version of the package as soon as possible. If your code depends on a package with a security vulnerability, this can cause a range of problems for your project or the people who use it. Using a vulnerable package makes you a soft target for malicious users looking to exploit your system.
