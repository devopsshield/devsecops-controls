  "description": "Minimize the usage and sharing of your organization secrets. Protect your secrets by declaring them as environment secrets and use required reviewers to protect environment secrets. The organization secret visibility should be limited to only fewer selected repositories. Anyone with collaborator access to the repositories with access to a secret or variable can use it for Actions. They are not passed to workflows that are triggered by a pull request from a fork.
