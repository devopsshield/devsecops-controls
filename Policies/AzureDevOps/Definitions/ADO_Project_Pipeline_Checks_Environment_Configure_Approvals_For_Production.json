  "description": "Approvers should grant approval for deployment. Extend pipeline protection by configuring a manual approval check on each of your resources. This will automatically stop your pipeline from running on top of any user branches. Most pipelines need a second set of eyes look over changes (especially to the pipeline itself) before deploying to production. Checks allow you to pause the pipeline run until certain conditions are met.
