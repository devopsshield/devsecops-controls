  "description": "Use workload identity federation for your Azure Resource Manager (ARM) service connections. Workload identity federation allows you to create secret-free service connections in Azure Pipelines to Azure. Convert your existing Azure Resource Manager service connections which use secrets to authenticate to leverage Workload identity federation instead, for improved security and simplified maintenance.
